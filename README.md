# AI-Powered-Chatbot-Transformers-

An interactive command-line AI chatbot built using Hugging Face Transformers and the GPT-2 language model.
This project demonstrates how transformer-based models can generate human-like text responses in real time with just a few lines of Python.

✨ Features

🧠 Powered by GPT-2 (Transformer-based language model)

💬 Real-time conversational responses

🖥️ Simple CLI interface

⚙️ Customizable generation parameters (temperature, top-p, token length)

🧩 Beginner-friendly and easy to extend

💻 Runs on CPU (no GPU required)

📦 Tech Stack

Python 3.8+

Hugging Face Transformers

PyTorch

GPT-2

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
